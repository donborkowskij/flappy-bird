# flappy bird cam

This is a fun twist on the classic Flappy Bird game - instead of tapping a key or clicking, the bird flaps when *you open your mouth*! Using real-time face detection and mouth-tracking through your webcam, your facial movement becomes the controller.

##  How to Play

- **Open your mouth** to make the bird jump.
- Try to fly through the pipes without crashing.
- The longer you survive, the higher your score!

##  Features

- Real-time mouth detection via webcam
- Simple and responsive controls (just your face!)
- Classic side-scrolling Flappy Bird gameplay

##  Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **OpenCV** - for webcam input and face/mouth tracking
- **Pygame** - for rendering game graphics and handling game logic

##  Requirements

Make sure you have a working webcam. The game uses it to detect when your mouth is open.

# flappy-bird-AI
This project uses NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to train an AI agent to play Flappy Bird. The neural networks evolve over generations to improve gameplay performance without any hardcoded rules.

- Each bird is controlled by a neural network
- NEAT evolves these networks over generations based on fitness
- Better-performing birds reproduce and mutate to create the next generation
